# Simon Says Game

This is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon Says game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, you'll need to remember and repeat a sequence of colors and sounds. With each level, the sequence gets longer, testing your memory and concentration.

## How to Play

0. Make sure you have an active internet connection first.
1. Open the `https://dipanshunamdev799.github.io/simon-says/` file in your web browser.
2. Click anywhere on the screen or press any key to start the game.
3. The game will begin by showing you a random color and playing a corresponding sound.
4. Repeat the sequence by clicking on the colored pads in the correct order.
5. If you enter the correct sequence, the game will move to the next level, and a new color will be added to the sequence.
6. If you make a mistake, the game will end, and you'll have to start over from the beginning.

The objective is to remember and repeat the longest sequence possible. Your score is based on the level you achieve.
